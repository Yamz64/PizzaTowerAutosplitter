# PizzaTowerAutosplitter
Autosplitters for both the any% speedrun and the John% run

--INSTALLATION--
The zip file contains both a version for the any percent and john percent (true ending) speedrun, so be sure to use the correct one for whichever run you wish to do!

1) Open up livesplit
2) Rightclick on your splits and navigate to "Edit Layout..."
3) Click the '+' icon and add a "Control" > "Scriptable Auto Splitter"
4) Double click on the new "Scriptable Auto Splitter" that got added to your list
5) Change the Script path to wherever your autosplit script is located

--NOTES--
The Autosplitter functions based off from room_ids, so it will automatically make a split as soon as the room loads.  The autosplitter also breaks if you undo a split during a run, so please do not do that!  It will manually handle the majority of tasks aside from ending a run, and resetting a run, so you need to remember to hit the split button when leaving the Pizza Tower!
